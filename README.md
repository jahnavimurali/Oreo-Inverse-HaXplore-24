## Project Vihara: User App

This application was developed as part of the 72-hour online hackathon HaxPlore CodeFest 2024 conducted by IIT BHU, Varanasi.

### About

Vihara is a modern ticketing system for seamless access to temples. Users can book tickets for darshans/pujas at convenient slots and make donations to the temple via various secure payment gateways. A booking ID and QR code is generated for each payment made, for seamless and secure payment/ entry confirmation, enabling temples to track variables such as number of visitors, waiting times, etc. 

This repository contains the user app for our project built using React Native Expo.
